Overview:
This report documents the results of a vulnerability scanning exercise conducted on the simulated network environment 192.168.1.0/24.

Tools Used:
- Nmap
- Nikto
- OpenVAS

Findings:

1. Outdated Apache Version (Critical)
   - Apache version vulnerable to remote code execution
   - Detected via Nikto and OpenVAS

2. Open SSH Port (High)
   - SSH port accessible to all IPs
   - Outdated encryption algorithms detected

Recommendations:
- Apply latest patches and updates to all systems
- Restrict SSH access to trusted IP ranges only
- Disable directory listing on all web directories
- Apply recommended HTTP security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Conduct regular vulnerability scans to monitor for new risks
