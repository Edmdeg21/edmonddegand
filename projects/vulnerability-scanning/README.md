# Vulnerability Scanning Project

## 📄 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **vulnerability scanning tools** to identify weaknesses across simulated systems in a controlled lab environment. The tools used include **Nmap, Nikto, and OpenVAS**.

The goal was to detect **open ports, outdated software, misconfigurations**, and **known vulnerabilities**. The project follows a **standard vulnerability management lifecycle**, including **scanning, analysis, and remediation recommendations**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify **open services** and **misconfigured systems**.
- Detect **outdated software versions** vulnerable to known exploits.
- Document findings and provide **remediation recommendations**.
- Showcase proficiency with **Nmap**, **Nikto**, and **OpenVAS/Nessus**.
